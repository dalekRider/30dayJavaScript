# 30dayJavaScript - Twisted Version

This is my twist on the 30 Day JavaScript Drum Kit. I decided to make a Dr Who sound board. Currently there are only 8 sound bytes, but more can easily be added. I am using Grid for the layout.

The functionality is the same, but there are a few things I will need to tweak. Currently the soundbytes overlap each other and this will need to be corrected. I need to set up the js so it stops a currently playing sound byte when a different one started. Addtionally I think I will add click functionality as well.
