# 30dayJavaScript
My Attempt at the 30 Day JavaScript Challenge by WesBos

I have decided to pick up the gauntlet and throw myself into Wes Bos' 30 day JavaScript Challenge. You can check out the challenge through the links below.

I plan to follow the tutorials complete the projects daily. This repsository will hold my completed versions of the challenge. If possible I will try to create an additional version of the the challenge with a twist. Additional versions will have different HTML/CSS. They will also use the javascript to acheive a similar but different goal from the tutorial. One example would be instead of a drum machine, maybe make a soundboard. 

Structure:
Each daily challenge will have its own folder. Folders will consist of one index.html file with the original solution, one index.html file with the twisted verstion and an asset folder with supporting files, like images, CSS, JS etc.

My goal for this challenge is to gain additional knowledge of JavaScript, reinforce my current understanding of JavaScript and get more practical application experience. Use it or lose it right? With this being Thanksgiving I will start Day 1 on Friday, Nov 22nd 2017.

Allons y!!!
