# 30dayJavaScript
My Attempt at the 30 Day JavaScript Challenge by WesBos

I have decided to pick up the gauntlet and throw myself into Wes Bos' 30 day JavaScript Challenge. You can check out the challenge through the links below.

https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30<br />
You can track my progress [HERE](https://dalekrider.github.io/30dayJavaScript/ "My #javascript30 Page"):

I plan to follow the tutorials complete the projects daily. This repsository will hold my completed versions of the challenge. If possible I will try to create an additional version of the the challenge with a twist. Additional versions will have different HTML/CSS. They will also use the javascript to acheive a similar but different goal from the tutorial. One example would be instead of a drum machine, maybe make a soundboard. 

Structure:
Each daily challenge will have its own folder. Folders will consist of one index.html file with the original solution, one index.html file with the twisted verstion and an asset folder with supporting files, like images, CSS, JS etc.

My goal for this challenge is to gain additional knowledge of JavaScript, reinforce my current understanding of JavaScript and get more practical application experience. Use it or lose it right? With this being Thanksgiving I will start Day 1 on Friday, Nov 24th 2017.

Allons y!!!

#### UPDATE 12/10/2017

Over the couple of weeks I have decided to change the process in which I am going about this challenge. Initially I decided I would make _twisted_ versions where applicable on a daily basis. This does a few things: it reinforces understanding if the lesson, provides personal practical application, and lets me practice building various page styles. I did create a few twisted versions for some of the lesson, however I found myself slapping together some sloppy pages when under a time crunch. What I have decided to do instead is complete the 30 day challenge, then restart the challenge creating only _twisted_ versions.

Additionally you may notice I have gotten behind. Unfortunately, between the long work hours, leg injury, and Christmas preparations this had to take a back burner. I am playing catch up today and will be back on track by tomorrow.

_tl;dr_

* Complete challenge w/ normal excerises
* Add readme each day with possible twisted version and notes about challenge
* Start twisted version of challenge once original completed

#### UPDATE 1/15/2017

I completed this course, it took 31 days rather than 30, but due to the Holiday season I am ok with that. I will be cycling back through to finish out the twisted versions along with readme files just journaling about the lesson. I have a few irons in the fire at the moment so I am prioritizing tasks, and planning my next moves. I have have also started the job hunt the last couple of weeks. This means I have had to devote time to taking assessments, brushing up on knowledge, and interviewing. 

So what does this have to do with this Repo? Well I compiled a list of tasks/todos for myself and will be knocking them out in weekly sprints. For example this week I plan to complete the following items

* Review/Add/Correct Readme files for all my repos.
* Check and fix any bugs/issue on current repos.
* Review my portfolio sketch for changes or approve final draft.
* Select and read one A Book Apart.
* Mock up one section of portfolio.
* Select one repo to take from script to app then skecth layout (ex. sleep calculator).

Ultimately there are a lot of items I would like to complete. So I am focusing on the items that can be completed first, while also working on my new portfolio. This means that my twisted version of the JS 30 Day Challenge will wait until I have completed all the other projects on my github account.
